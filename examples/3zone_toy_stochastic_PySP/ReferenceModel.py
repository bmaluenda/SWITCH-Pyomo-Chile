"""

Generate a model for use with the PySP pyomo module, either for use with the
runef or runph commands. Both these scripts require a single .py file that
creates a pyomo model object named "model".

The inputs_dir parameter must match the inputs directory being used for the
current simulation.

The example in which this model generator is framed doesn't use the
fuel_markets module. This script is tailored to treat all the Switch model's
annual costs as resulting from the first stage decisions and the timepoint
costs as product of the second stage decision variables. This ReferenceModel
will produce incorrect results if the fuel_markets module is included in the
simulation, which includes fuel costs in the annual components of the
objective function. That would include second stage decisions in the
calculation of the first stage costs, resulting in different RootNode costs
per scenario, which is incongruent.
