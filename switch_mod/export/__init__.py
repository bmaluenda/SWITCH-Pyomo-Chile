Functions to help export results.

Modules within this directory may implement custom exports that
depend on multiple Switch modules. Each individual Switch module
that defines components should only access model components that
it defined or that were defined upstream in Switch modules that 
it depends on. For example, the load_zone module cannot assume whether users
will be including project.no_commit or project.unitcommit, so it cannot
reference model components defined in either of those files. However,
both project.no_commit and project.unitcommit can assume that components
defined in load_zones will be available because they have an explicit
dependency on load_zones.
