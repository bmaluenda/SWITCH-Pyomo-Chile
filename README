This contains the Switch electricity planning model written in Pyomo.
This optimization model is modular and can be used with varying levels
of complexity. Look in the examples directory for demonstrations of
using Switch for investment planning or production cost simulation. The
examples enable varying levels of model complexity by choosing which
modules to include.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

The doc folder contains auto-generated documentation from the python doc
strings. This should include descriptions of each module, their
intentions, model components they define, and what input files they
expect. To refresh the documentation, go to the folder and run
./make_doc.sh This documentation is not well-formatted or pretty, but it
will do until we migrate to Sphinx and invest more effort into writing
higher-level documentation and tutorials.


TESTING
To test the entire codebase, run this command from the root directory:

./run_tests.py


EXAMPLES
To run an example, first update the python path to include the source directory.
If you downloaded the project to ~/src/switch, the commands are:
    cd ~/src/switch
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)":"$PYTHONPATH
    cd examples/copperplate0
    python -m switch_mod.solve --verbose
